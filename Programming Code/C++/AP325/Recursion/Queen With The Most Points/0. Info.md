## Key Point A

`How to calaulate the point which queen stand on ?`

We can take a look for the code first.

```cpp
if( k >= n ){
    int res = 0;
    for( int i = 0 ; i < k ; i++ ){
        res += arr[p[i]][i];
    }
    return res; // No more rows, successful
}
```

First, wa can know that if the queen's placement is legal, it will only come in this judgement.

So, we only need to calculate the situation in this judgement.

## Key Point B

`How to deal with whether the queen wants to let go ?`

We can use a simple concept to solve this problem. 

It is make queen who didn't to be put to the extra space ( like the end of the array [ i ] )

And after some trivial proccessing there is no problems.
